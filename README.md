# Street View House Number Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks

_Multi-character text recognition in photographs of unconstrained natural environments is a tough computer vi-sion problem. One of the complications in this area isrecognition of house numbers on buildings in Street View Imagery. A system which successfully detects house numbers with high efficiency can be used to improve map accuracy. House number recognition also helps improve address geocoding. As it is almost impossible to manually detect and transcribe billions of house numbers in images, there is a need of a digit recognition system that can automate this task. The aim of this project is to implement a system that can detect and transcribe house numbers from the SVHN data set automatically._
